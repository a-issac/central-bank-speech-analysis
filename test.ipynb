      "  The role of the European Union in fostering convergence   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Conference on European Economic Integration (CEEI), Vienna, 26 November 2018 This[1] conference was renamed 14 years ago to reflect the “growing together of Europe”.[2] In my remarks today I would like to focus precisely on these three topics: growth, Europe and togetherness. ---- [ 7.199926  -4.5967913 -5.320073 ]\n",
      "I will argue that these three elements are needed to accomplish what the Treaty on European Union promises: economic and social cohesion.[3]  I will focus my remarks today on the economies of central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE), covering both those that are already part of the European Union (EU) and those that are EU candidate countries or potential candidates.[4]  I will start with a brief review of the current state of convergence of CESEE economies, and then explain how three key European policy areas – the completion of the Single Market, the launch of a true capital markets union and the targeted use of EU funds – can help accelerate convergence and thereby also foster cohesion in Europe. ---- [ 8.267164 -5.4537   -6.026827]\n",
      "The current state of convergence CESEE economies have seen significant improvements in living standards over the past two decades, in both absolute and relative terms.[5] Since 2000, growth in real GDP per capita has averaged 3.8% in the region as a whole, compared with 1.4% for the EU-28. ---- [-1.054943   5.3263373 -5.544593 ]\n",
      "As a result, we have seen these economies make measurable and welcome progress in catching up to the EU average.[6]  But this catching-up process has been neither linear over time nor homogeneous across countries. ---- [-3.5228987  6.7705665 -5.326955 ]\n",
      "You can see this on my first slide. ---- [ 6.5737514 -5.455772  -4.46262  ]\n",
      "   Clearly, for most countries, convergence towards the EU-28 average has practically stalled since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 – this is the difference between the yellow dot and the upper end of the blue bar. ---- [ 1.1493024 -5.411037   6.043931 ]\n",
      "And before the crisis, convergence was noticeably faster in economies that were already part of the euro area. ---- [ 1.3363742 -1.9979572 -3.8041167]\n",
      "In many of these economies, relative living standards increased by half, from 40 to 50% of the EU average in 2000, to around 70% in 2016. ---- [ 3.085592  -1.7347971 -4.6881056]\n",
      "But the further one moves to the right on this slide, and contrary to what neoclassical growth theory would suggest, the less compelling strong convergence becomes. ---- [ 0.36026594 -3.9052982   2.5697396 ]\n",
      " In the Western Balkans, for example, while relative income levels have increased, they have done so at a much slower pace. ---- [ 0.46470994 -3.993812    1.5254867 ]\n",
      "At current growth rates, fast convergence towards the EU-28 average will remain illusory for many EU candidate countries or potential candidates. ---- [ 3.0006638  -5.1655655  -0.27389455]\n",
      "These economies, and this you can see on my next slide, would need much higher GDP growth rates than in previous years to even reach half of the EU-28 average within the next 20 years or so, with the possible exception of Montenegro. ---- [ 0.73401165 -0.69853765 -3.5951679 ]\n",
      "   Clearly, this pace of convergence is disappointing. ---- [-2.4422362 -4.851643  10.551325 ]\n",
      "It implies that living standards in Europe will remain highly varied and uneven for a considerable period of time, even within the EU. ---- [ 3.132831 -6.538654  1.378766]\n",
      "And if there is no credible prospect of lower-income countries catching up soon, there is a risk that people living in those countries begin questioning the very benefits of membership of the EU or the currency union. ---- [-0.56031966 -5.017428    8.73459   ]\n",
      "Such doubts would be particularly worrisome in the unstable world we are currently living in. ---- [-1.682433 -4.294437  9.721111]\n",
      "We need the EU to remain a force for change, a source of growth and development and an anchor of stability. ---- [ 2.803314  -4.134756  -3.3976016]\n",
      "Action is therefore needed on two main fronts: first, to bring convergence in EU Member States back onto its pre-crisis path and, second, to jump-start convergence in EU candidate countries and potential candidates. ---- [ 4.748698  -4.348689  -5.2438145]\n",
      "To understand what needs to be done to tackle both challenges, it is useful to look at the drivers of growth and the factors that have recently been holding them back. ---- [ 5.384082  -4.3106894 -3.5008159]\n",
      "You can see this on my next slide. ---- [ 6.764119  -5.4726515 -4.7602715]\n",

      "During the transition phase, growth is typically based on capital and labour accumulation, and only later on TFP growth.[7] Or, to borrow the words of Paul Krugman, it is based first on perspiration and only later on inspiration.[8]  The flipside is that these economies are now faced with a notable capital shortfall. ---- [ 3.342115  -6.0627666  1.3960761]\n",

      "The second fact worth highlighting is that the remarkable contribution of productivity to growth, both in the upswing and in the downturn, is likely to be an artefact of the growth model adopted by most CESEE economies. ---- [-5.620416   9.617084  -5.7536097]\n",

      "The transfer of technology, moreover, does not stop at firms directly integrated into global value chains, but also extends to their domestic suppliers via local production networks.[10]  Empirical evidence shows that, in the case of central and eastern European (CEE) economies, this transfer of technology has contributed to both strong TFP growth in the run-up to the crisis and to its more recent slowdown.[11]  You can see this more clearly on my next slide. ---- [-4.954872   9.909724  -7.6352825]\n",

      "This link likely reflects the scale and scope of technology spillovers.[12] So, as FDI inflows decelerated and participation rates in global value chains levelled off, TFP growth in CESEE economies abated too. ---- [-3.5289013 -1.5712854  6.2294865]\n",
      "   Global value chains as a source of TFP growth in the future In sum, therefore, this diagnosis highlights two key facts: CESEE economies have a lack of capital, and a strong reliance on global production processes. ---- [-1.821159  -4.0818515  9.835944 ]\n",
      "The easy answer, of course, is to brush away weakness in FDI inflows as a temporary phenomenon. ---- [-1.7422973 -2.967141   6.332112 ]\n",

      "First, natural disasters and increasing climate-related disruptions have led firms to rethink the length and design of their value chains to mitigate the risks of costly supply disruptions.[14] This is becoming increasingly visible and may still amplify as climate change takes its toll on our economies. ---- [ 0.4543969 -3.5435517  4.657059 ]\n",
      "Second, in the past sizeable wage differentials for unskilled labour made the international fragmentation of production processes worthwhile. ---- [-0.2760064 -3.500155   3.6692688]\n",
      "Some of these wage differentials have narrowed considerably as emerging economies have grown richer. ---- [ 3.028019  -3.5033596 -3.2098541]\n",

      "By some estimates, the average price of industrial robots has declined by about 40% over the past ten years and is projected to fall considerably further.[16] A survey by the Boston Consulting Group revealed that more than 70% of senior manufacturing executives in the United States think that robotics improve the economics of local production.[17]  The implication is that, to the extent that growing automation and narrowing wage differentials make the outsourcing of production processes less profitable, policymakers in CESEE economies, and in emerging market economies more generally, will need to think about developing other growth models. ---- [ 0.3503865 -2.855351   2.3238263]\n",
      " To reboot TFP growth and deepen capital accumulation they will need to stimulate domestic investment spending and help new, innovative industries to grow and develop. ---- [ 0.84318227 -0.22209248 -4.195822  ]\n",

      "The EU’s Single Market can be a valuable source of competitive advantage for firms located in CESEE economies, in particular when competing with other economies at similar stages of development. ---- [-3.684664  8.253283 -8.491665]\n",
      " It is the largest market in the world, offering the benefits of enormous economies of scale, and has helped establish product and safety standards that are used worldwide. ---- [-6.6302047 12.186019  -7.5282736]\n",
      "There is compelling evidence that the Single Market has had a positive impact on exports, investment, innovation and productivity.[18]  To exploit its full potential, and to accelerate convergence, two things need to be done. ---- [-6.1860843 11.423273  -6.2541237]\n",
      "First, Member States need to strengthen its enforcement so that Single Market initiatives translate into concrete and positive effects on the ground. ---- [-3.66759   5.858418 -5.709728]\n",
      " A key ingredient for this is efficient administration at all levels of government. ---- [-1.0074253  4.3959455 -7.29196  ]\n",
      "Indeed, a lack of real convergence in income levels is, more often than not, the result of a lack of convergence in institutional quality.[19] You can see this on my next slide – a slide I like to show because I think it makes a compelling point, notwithstanding the usual caveat on the two-way causality between institutional quality and income levels.[20]     Most CESEE economies are still in the lower left-hand corner, meaning there remains a significant gap in overall institutional quality compared with the average level observed in the EU as a whole. ---- [ 3.4705055 -4.130801  -1.6063466]\n",
      " Some EU Member States have recently renewed their interest in the process leading to participation in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and the adoption of the euro. ---- [ 5.480973  -6.1672115 -2.7183695]\n",

      " This is particularly relevant for CESEE economies. ---- [ 3.9886873 -4.7180095 -1.4991349]\n",
      "As you can see on my next slide, most of these countries are still classified as modest or moderate innovators. ---- [ 7.7208276 -7.3176274 -2.7836452]\n",
      "There have been some notable improvements in certain countries over time, but in others the process of gradually catching up with their EU peers appears to have stalled, or even to have backtracked, in recent years. ---- [-3.523369  -2.2596865  7.613404 ]\n",
      "    The first priority is therefore to complete the Single Market for services, which already account for two-thirds of global GDP and employment, and represent many of the potential growth sectors in the age of digitalisation and automation. ---- [ 2.805961   -0.31679907 -6.852956  ]\n",
      " Research by the ESCB’s Competitive Research Network (CompNet) shows, for example, that many firms in the EU services sector are far behind the productivity frontier, particularly in CESEE economies.[21] Reallocating capital and labour to more productive firms would help boost overall competitiveness and support employment. ---- [-4.284839  8.605189 -6.562459]\n",
      "A second, and more direct, avenue is to increase efforts to build a “European data economy”, or a digital single market, as also advocated by the European Commission in its communication last week.[22] Digitalisation offers a particularly promising opportunity for catching-up economies to leapfrog more advanced economies and adopt new technologies faster than them, thereby mitigating the risk of being hurt by reshoring and premature deindustrialisation. ---- [-6.110989 10.566837 -6.4746  ]\n",
      "Convergence and the role of the capital markets union The second key area where Europe can help – which is close to the heart of this conference – is by channelling funds to where they can be used most productively. ---- [ 3.6999757 -2.700902  -5.511536 ]\n",
      "There is compelling evidence of the importance of finance for technological innovation and, ultimately, long-run growth rates.[23] Differences in the quality of financial intermediation across countries have been found to have significant implications for economic growth.[24]  In particular, research is increasingly challenging the view that bank and market-based finance tend to support economic development and living standards in similar ways. ---- [ 2.4809196 -5.281639   4.499771 ]\n",
      " Evidence is growing globally that large banking systems are associated with more systemic risk and lower economic growth, in particular as countries grow richer.[25] In addition, recent work by ECB staff highlights that, during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, capital misallocation increased substantially among firms that were more reliant on bank finance.[26]  Other research suggests that deeper equity markets are more effective in promoting innovation and productivity and, hence, in bringing economies closer to the technological frontier.[27] Recent ECB research, for example, suggests that if an EU Member State were to increase its ratio of stock market capitalisation to bank credit from the 25th to the 75th percentile, the average growth rate of its most high-tech industry could be expected to increase by 3.1 percentage points, everything else being equal.[28]  None of this is to say that banks will become redundant. ---- [ 0.26251477  1.1985399  -5.3165283 ]\n",

      "The European push towards a capital markets union, for example, reflects not only the need for increased cross-border risk-sharing in a currency union, but also the hope that deeper and better-integrated equity markets will support innovation and productivity growth in the European Union.[29]  This also includes making new innovative financial technologies available to firms and ensuring they are as safe as conventional technologies. ---- [-5.5776687 10.301665  -5.466376 ]\n",

      "Although EU data requirements are more stringent – for good reason – there is considerable scope for such technologies, if used prudently, to also foster growth and convergence in the EU. ---- [ 1.9853228 -1.8533627 -3.8655832]\n",
      "On my next slide you can see that in Europe more generally, and in most CESEE economies in particular, these technologies have not yet gained much traction. ---- [ 0.6143948 -5.102025   6.119982 ]\n",
      "In other words, progress towards a true capital markets union can both support the funding of investments, thereby helping overcome the current lack of capital accumulation, and, at the same time, foster the use and distribution of new financial technologies that may themselves become a source of growth.[30]     Using EU funds to foster convergence The third area where Europe can help is arguably the most contentious one. ---- [-1.481691   5.0022025 -7.169158 ]\n",
      "It relates to transfers between Member States to foster convergence in the EU. ---- [ 6.4825387 -6.221248  -4.414407 ]\n",

      "Such patterns are even more visible when considering EU funding opportunities for social policies, education and training.[31] Under the European Fund for Strategic Investments plan, for example, CESEE economies have only been able to attract less than 5% of total funding allocated to social infrastructure projects. ---- [ 3.682717   -6.295379    0.68451893]\n",

       "  Monetary policy in Europe - Quo Vadis?   Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Monetary Institute London, 27 November 1997 Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in a fortunate position in Europe. We have been able to prepare a new monetary regime for Europe at a time when a consensus about the role of monetary policy exists among central bankers and the large majority of politicians and academics. We are thus able to shape the new institutions accordingly.  Let me first explain what I mean by the current consensus about the role of monetary policy among macroeconomists. Second, having established the state of the art (and it is certainly still true that central banking is more of an art than a science), I shall briefly describe my vision of how monetary policy could ideally be run in Europe, while illustrating my view that the structure of the ESCB and its operating procedures are in line with these standards, and may thus be able to transform that vision into reality.   A consensus in monetary policy   The views expressed in the following statements would nowadays be shared by a large majority of economists:  1 Monetary policy cannot influence the growth rate of the economy by having an effect on aggregate demand in the long run. Economic growth depends on the productivity and the supply of factors of production such as labour and capital. No central bank in the world is able to increase its country's growth rate permanently by printing money or even by reducing the nominal interest rate to zero. The reason being that any excess demand over the production of goods and services will sooner or later be reflected in inflation. Persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Although monetary policy action can exert a temporary influence on the level of real economic activity - due particularly to sluggish adjustment of wages and prices. An \"activist\" monetary policy though aimed at boosting growth without due regard for price stability will merely cause inflation.  2 Expectations of market participants such as trade unions and employers are of crucial importance for the effect of any policy measure, and the expected reaction pattern of the central bank affects current decisions by the private sector. Let me give you an example. If the central bank is known to react to excessive wage demands by raising interest rates, thereby stabilising prices and temporarily reducing output, instead of by lowering rates to dampen the burden on firms affected by the wage shock, excessive wage demands may not occur in the first place. Thus, if the goal of price stability is evident and credible, stable monetary policy will become much easier to implement.  3 High inflation hampers economic growth. High and volatile inflation imposes substantial economic costs, such as those arising from increased uncertainty about the outcome of investment decisions and profitability, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-term interest rates and the reduced allocative effectiveness of the price and market system. In addition, social costs arise because the weaker members of society have more difficulty in protecting themselves against the adverse effects of inflation. There is agreement that inflation should be low, but no full consensus on what that exactly means in quantitative terms. Many of my European colleagues and myself would put the level at between 0 and 2%. Some others would envisage a somewhat wider range.   Implications for European monetary policy  On the basis of these views, the implications for a price stability oriented monetary policy in Europe are clear, and can be articulated as follows:  (i) given the desirability of low inflation, and since persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, it follows that a central bank's goal should be price stability;  (ii) in pursuing the goal of price stability monetary policy may contribute to smoothing the level of economic activity in the short run, if inflationary pressures tend to follow a cyclical pattern. It should be noted that the success of such action depends crucially on the credibility of monetary policy;  (iii) it goes without saying that monetary policy and fiscal policy should be well aligned as an adverse policy mix would imply placing an excessive burden on monetary policy;  (iv) the importance of conditioning expectations and thus establishing the credibility of the central bank's anti-inflationary stance requires independent central banking. A monetary authority should be able to act free of political pressure, and according to transparent policy rules which should also be communicated to the public. A rule which aims at stabilising prices - either via a direct inflation target or a money supply target - will smoothen the business cycle and allow the economy to grow at its potential growth rate;  Some of the past mistakes and deficiencies of monetary policy which have contributed over time to the emergence of the consensus I have just described have stemmed from a lack of independence. This has included attempts to use monetary policy for fiscal purposes (such as trying to reduce the real debt burden by surprise inflation) and the many unsuccessful attempts to boost growth through inflation, ignoring the effects on market expectations. A central bank which abandons its price stability target for a transitory gain in economic activity only contributes to higher average inflation. A central bank which has been susceptible to public pressure usually hits the brakes too late, too hard and, I might add, with unnecessarily heavy wear and tear on the \"tyres\" - aggravating the volatility of the business cycle rather than smoothing it out. I say this despite some proposals (Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist of the World Bank) claiming that \"we should not follow a policy of pre-emptive strikes, but rather one of cautious expansionism\" with which I disagree. This kind of strategy would mean in case of doubt letting the central bank err on the side of being too expansionary. The argument is that the costs of a minor increase in average inflation will be more than compensated by gains in employment. In my opinion, this argument again neglects the effect of market expectations. When people realise the systematic bias in the central banks monetary policy rule, there will be no output gain attached to the undoubtedly higher inflation rate. Nevertheless, there are costs involved. Even starting from low levels, higher inflation means higher volatility, which will then be reflected in higher risk premia and thus higher real interest rates - and eventually lower growth rates.   The future ESCB  If we cast an eye over the structure of the future European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the impression we get is that lessons have been learned and economic theory applied in the best possible manner. Maintaining price stability will be the ESCB's primary responsibility. Without prejudice to this primary objective of price stability, the ESCB will support the general economic policies in the European Union. The Maastricht Treaty assigns independence to the ESCB for the purpose of carrying out its mandate. With regard to monetary strategy, monetary and inflation targeting are seen as the two benchmarks on the basis of which the ESCB's strategy in Stage Three will be selected. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty, which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact clearly defines the exceptional circumstances under which excessive deficits are allowed and provides for a procedure which will ensure that excessive deficits are swiftly corrected, should they nevertheless arise, thus protecting the euro area against an unfavourable policy mix. The ESCB is prohibited from financing government debt. Thus the ESCB is relieved of any possible pressure to accommodate public debt by means of an expansionary monetary policy, which could otherwise have been interpreted as a constraint on its independence.  I would like to conclude by stating that the essence of good monetary policy is good institutional design. Apparently, lessons have been learned and principles have been applied successfully. Europe has the opportunity to bring what has at times been a tumultuous chapter in its monetary history to a close. It should seize that opportunity and enjoy the benefits that sustained price stability will bring. The task ahead is to broaden and deepen the public's understanding of and support for the strategy and tactics of monetary policy and to lock in credibility for achieving low inflation, stable growth and lasting employment creation.
