       "['  The economic crisis and the response of fiscal and monetary policy   Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBDelivered at the Austrian Industrial OrganisationLinz, Austria, 8 June 2009      Introduction    Following the default of Lehman Brothers in mid-September last year, the turmoil in financial markets which had started in August 2007 turned into a major financial crisis.',\n",
       " 'Liquidity dried up, and credit flows to the economy slowed down.',\n",
       " 'Problems in the financial system quickly spilled over to the real economy, and an adverse feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector emerged.',\n",
       " 'This has led to the most severe and synchronised global economic downturn for 80 years.',\n",
       " 'The euro area has not been spared.',\n",
       " 'Economic activity has declined sharply, and inflation is at its lowest level since the launch of the euro.',\n",
       " 'Monetary and fiscal authorities across the globe have responded quickly and decisively to these extraordinary developments.',\n",
       " 'In particular, against the background of rapidly receding inflationary pressures and risks, the Eurosystem has taken monetary policy and liquidity management measures that were unprecedented in nature, scope and timing.',\n",
       " 'Since October last year we have reduced the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by 325 basis points.',\n",
       " 'We have also provided unlimited liquidity support to the banking system in the euro area to maintain the flow of credit.',\n",
       " 'Likewise, governments in the euro area have reacted swiftly to stabilise the financial system and to counteract the adverse impact of the financial crisis on the real economy.',\n",
       " 'Looking ahead, both monetary and fiscal authorities will need to remain credible and effective, and to fulfil their respective responsibilities.',\n",
       " 'In so doing, they will lay solid foundations for future economic recovery and long-term economic growth and job creation.',\n",
       " 'The crisis has shown how important it is to have an independent central bank firmly committed to the objective of price stability.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, governments must make a strong and credible commitment to a path of fiscal consolidation and thus comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.',\n",
       " 'But they must also resist the temptation to further increase the size of the stimulus measures, as this could erode trust in the sustainability of public finances and undermine the effectiveness of the measures already adopted.',\n",
       " 'In my presentation today, I would like first to analyse the economic outlook and then discuss in more detail the policy measures taken in response to the crisis.',\n",
       " 'I will then consider their implications and the lessons to be drawn from the crisis for central banks and monetary policy.',\n",
       " 'Economic outlook        a.',\n",
       " 'Global economic situation    Let me begin with the assessment of the global economic situation.',\n",
       " 'The turmoil in financial markets, which was triggered by a systematic under-pricing of risk, particularly in the US sub-prime mortgage market, has now developed into a fully-fledged financial and economic crisis at global level.',\n",
       " 'While the world economy continues to face a severe and synchronised downturn, recent international business confidence indicators suggest that the pace of the decline in economic activity is slowing down somewhat.',\n",
       " 'Most forecasters expect that the global economy is likely to recover in 2010, albeit at a gradual pace.',\n",
       " 'The June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which have just been published, are in line with this overall assessment.',\n",
       " 'They are based on the assumption that the global economy outside the euro area will contract by 1.6% this year grow and by 2.1% in 2010.',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, the economic prospects remain fraught with uncertainty.',\n",
       " 'Compared with a few months ago, overall risks to global economic growth have become more balanced.',\n",
       " 'A stronger positive confidence effect than expected triggered by the monetary and fiscal policy measures could lead to a more sustained recovery in global demand and in global trade, and a quicker normalisation of financial market and credit conditions.',\n",
       " 'Of course, if global policy actions fail to strike an appropriate balance between economic stimulus and longer-term sustainability, financial market conditions could turn unfavourable again.',\n",
       " 'Global inflation rates have continued to diminish rapidly.',\n",
       " 'This is mainly due to lower commodity prices, weaker labour market conditions and greater global economic slack.',\n",
       " 'Risks to global inflation seem to be broadly balanced in the short to medium term.',\n",
       " 'Beyond that horizon, however, inflation risks depend on how efficiently the authorities withdraw the policy stimulus.',\n",
       " 'b. Euro area activity     In line with global developments, economic activity in the euro area has also contracted sharply since the second half of 2008.',\n",
       " 'The euro area economy has shrunk by about 4% over the past two quarters, the worst decline since the start of Economic and Monetary Union.',\n",
       " 'For the current quarter, there is evidence that the economy has shrunk further, though at a slower pace.',\n",
       " 'The economy is no longer in free fall; we are seeing the first signs of stabilisation.',\n",
       " 'Indicators of consumer confidence and business sentiment have continued to improve somewhat.',\n",
       " 'We are also seeing some encouraging signs of normalisation in financial markets.',\n",
       " 'Looking ahead, the euro area economy is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010.',\n",
       " 'The Eurosystem staff projections for real GDP growth are broadly in line with the most recent forecasts from the IMF and the European Commission.',\n",
       " 'Both institutions expect the euro area economy to contract by 4% or more in 2009, followed by a gradual recovery in 2010.',\n",
       " 'Quarterly growth rates are expected to return to positive levels by mid-2010.',\n",
       " 'The projected gradual recovery reflects the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to make the financial system function normally both inside and outside the euro area.',\n",
       " 'c. Euro area price developments    Inflation in the euro area has declined rapidly since it reached its highest level, 4%, last summer.',\n",
       " 'In May, euro area HICP inflation was down to 0.0%, according to the preliminary estimate from Eurostat.',\n",
       " 'This is the lowest number registered since the launch of the euro.',\n",
       " 'The rapid decline over this period is primarily due to the marked fall in global commodity prices, and particularly oil prices.',\n",
       " 'If we exclude food and energy, however, HICP inflation over the past year has moderated only marginally.',\n",
       " 'In April, the most recent month for which we have data, HICP inflation excluding food and energy was 1.8%.',\n",
       " 'Inflation rates are likely to enter negative territory during the summer, but we expect them to turn positive by the end of 2009.',\n",
       " 'This can largely be explained by base effects from energy prices.',\n",
       " 'These effects are of no concern to the ECB, which aims to maintain price stability in the medium term.',\n",
       " 'In other words, its monetary policy strategy aims to ensure that short-term volatility in inflation rates does not lead to volatility in long-term inflation expectations.',\n",
       " 'It is important not to confuse the temporarily negative inflation rates we are likely to experience this summer with outright deflation.',\n",
       " 'Let me remind you of the difference: a deflationary process is a persistent, broad-based and self-sustaining fall in the overall price level.',\n",
       " 'It is reinforced by the anticipation that prices will decline further in the future.',\n",
       " 'As a consequence, inflation expectations become disanchored and negative, and firms and households may decide to postpone investments and major purchases.',\n",
       " 'In fact, what we are experiencing at the moment can be described as a period of rapid disinflation.',\n",
       " 'This is linked to transitory movements in relative prices and is in principle a welcome development.',\n",
       " 'Provided that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with price stability, low or negative inflation rates for a short period of time may help to sustain real income and may therefore stimulate spending.',\n",
       " 'But even if we expect inflation rates to turn positive again by the end of this year, the weak economic outlook for the euro area is expected to keep domestic price pressures contained for some time.',\n",
       " 'According to the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, HICP inflation in the euro area is likely to be very moderate, but above zero, on average this year.',\n",
       " 'Inflation is expected to pick up, but remain at a moderate level in 2010.',\n",
       " 'Forecasts produced by the European Commission and other international organisations paint a similar picture.',\n",
       " 'The risks to this outlook are viewed as broadly balanced.',\n",
       " 'However, in the longer term, it is important that the current policy stimulus is withdrawn in due course.',\n",
       " 'd. Monetary and financing conditions    Let me now turn to the monetary analysis, which is particularly useful for assessing risks to price stability in the medium to long term.',\n",
       " 'The latest money and credit data support the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term.',\n",
       " 'The deceleration of broad money growth observed in 2008 increased towards the turn of the year and continues at a rapid pace.',\n",
       " 'Developments in money and credit aggregates have been volatile over the past few months.',\n",
       " 'This may be explained partly by the sharp reduction in the key ECB interest rates, which may have encouraged shifts in the allocation of funds.',\n",
       " 'If we disregard this volatility, the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and in credit growth seems to reflect the sharp deterioration in economic activity.',\n",
       " 'As regards financing conditions in the euro area, external financing costs have been declining since October last year, and particularly sharply since the start of this year.',\n",
       " 'Following policy interest rate cuts, bank lending rates have fallen significantly.',\n",
       " 'This indicates that the pass-through mechanism from policy rates to the real economy has continued to function in recent months, even though there is evidence that banks’ margins have widened.',\n",
       " 'With credit spreads across all rating classes decreasing from their record highs and with stock prices rising, the overall cost of financing for euro area non-financial corporations is diminishing.',\n",
       " 'In general, the recent positive signs from financial markets point to a gradual improvement in confidence among investors.',\n",
       " 'Policy measures    I will now turn to the policy measures taken in response to the current crisis.',\n",
       " 'Both monetary and fiscal policy-makers have reacted in a forceful and timely manner, aiming to restore confidence.',\n",
       " 'And indeed, as regards the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and liquidity management measures, it seems that our responses are bearing fruit.',\n",
       " 'Confidence has returned to financial markets, and business surveys are picking up.',\n",
       " 'I expect global and domestic demand to increasingly benefit from the significant economic stimulus and the measures taken so far to bring the financial system back to normal functioning.',\n",
       " 'Monetary policy    The ECB has acted in a timely, decisive and appropriate manner since the start of the financial market turmoil.',\n",
       " 'We have cut our key policy rate by 325 basis points since last October, when the escalating financial crisis led to a rapid decline of inflationary pressures.',\n",
       " 'The interest rate on the main refinancing operations now stands at 1.0%, its lowest level since the launch of the euro.',\n",
       " 'This level is appropriate taking into account all information and analyses.',\n",
       " 'Money market rates have fallen even further to record lows, and the loan interest rates charged by banks have declined.',\n",
       " 'Our substantive monetary policy easing is already being felt in the real economy.',\n",
       " 'In addition to lowering the policy interest rate quickly and sharply, we have resorted to highly non-standard liquidity operations in order to provide the financial system with the liquidity that was so urgently needed.',\n",
       " 'Last October, we adopted a ‘fixed-rate full allotment’ procedure in all our open market operations.',\n",
       " 'This gives banks as much central bank liquidity as they want at our key policy interest rate, against an expanded list of eligible collateral.',\n",
       " \"Coupled with the fact that essentially all financially sound euro area credit institutions can participate in the Eurosystem's refinancing operations, these measures have significantly eased the banks’ balance sheet constraints, thereby avoiding a sudden stop in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis.\",\n",
       " 'At the Governing Council meeting in early May, we decided to extend the maturity range of these liquidity-providing operations from six to 12 months.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, we decided that the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area.',\n",
       " 'Last week we announced the details of this purchase programme.',\n",
       " 'These decisions were taken to enhance credit support to the economy through banks.',\n",
       " 'More specifically, all these measures aim to promote the ongoing decline in money market term rates, to encourage banks to maintain and expand their lending to clients, to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market, and to ease funding conditions for banks and enterprises.',\n",
       " 'These measures take into account the central role played by the euro area banking system in financing the economy.',\n",
       " 'This contrasts with the financial structure of other economic regions.',\n",
       " 'The above-mentioned measures led to a significant increase in the Eurosystem’s balance sheet: it reached a peak of 19% of GDP in December 2008 from 10% of GDP in mid-2007, up by €850 billion.',\n",
       " 'This increase in the size of the balance sheet corresponds to a higher level of outstanding refinancing operations, and has consequently increased the amount of risk borne by the Eurosystem.',\n",
       " 'Since its peak in December, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has declined by around €300 billion to 15% of GDP in May 2009.',\n",
       " 'This decline suggests a gradual increase in money market activity, at least for very short maturities.',\n",
       " 'The fact that we have taken on additional risk is no coincidence.',\n",
       " 'Whenever liquidity dries up because market participants are reluctant to lend to each other, the central bank has to step in, but at the same time not put its reputation at risk.',\n",
       " 'To summarise, we have employed a wide range of measures to counter the effect of the financial and economic crisis.',\n",
       " 'The approach we have followed has been tailored to the needs of the euro area, where the banking system plays a more important role in financing than in other major economies.',\n",
       " 'These differences are important for the implementation and transmission of monetary policy, and therefore the Eurosystem’s reactions to the crisis cannot be compared directly with those of other leading central banks.',\n",
       " 'Fiscal policy measures     Let me now turn to the fiscal policy reaction to the economic crisis.',\n",
       " 'Fiscal authorities in the euro area have demonstrated their willingness and capacity to act rapidly and in a coordinated manner in exceptional circumstances.',\n",
       " 'It is important to distinguish between measures intended to support the banking sector and fiscal policy measures aimed at stimulating demand.',\n",
       " 'Support for the banking sector    Government support for the banking sector was necessary; it has safeguarded the stability of the financial system.',\n",
       " 'The price of this success, however, is that governments have incurred substantial fiscal costs and credit risks that are ultimately borne by taxpayers.',\n",
       " 'Following the adoption of a concerted European action plan on 12 October 2008, euro area governments announced national measures to support the banking sector.',\n",
       " 'These measures consist of government guarantees for interbank lending, recapitalisation of financial institutions in difficulty, increase the coverage of retail deposit insurance and asset relief schemes.',\n",
       " 'Overall, euro area governments committed about 23% of euro area GDP to financial sector support measures.',\n",
       " 'For the euro area, the various support measures adopted so far are expected to have only a small direct impact on government deficits, whereas the impact on debt is expected to be about 3% of GDP.',\n",
       " 'Finally, contingent liabilities related to the financial rescue measures are expected to be about 8% of GDP, excluding government guarantees on retail deposits.',\n",
       " 'These figures, however, do not reflect the very different developments taking place across euro area countries.',\n",
       " 'Between end-September and end-October 2008, concurrent to the announcement of the broad-based bank rescue packages, an adverse shift in market sentiment towards sovereign borrowers occurred.',\n",
       " 'It became more expensive to insure against the default of euro area countries, and this change of mood was reflected in significantly higher sovereign CDS premia for euro area countries.',\n",
       " 'This would suggest that the bank rescue packages brought about an increase in public sector credit risk.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, long-term government bond yield spreads vis-à-vis Germany have widened substantially for most euro area countries.',\n",
       " 'These spreads mainly reflect perceptions of differing liquidity and credit risk among countries.',\n",
       " 'The fact that developments in government bond yield spreads have mirrored higher sovereign CDS premia suggests that concerns about fiscal sustainability have become an important factor, affecting investors’ perceptions.',\n",
       " 'In particular, government bond yield spreads seem to be higher in those Member States regarded as particularly vulnerable in the current environment.',\n",
       " 'Among the relevant factors are current fiscal imbalances, but also external imbalances, and they could ultimately have repercussions on the general government budget.',\n",
       " 'Past fiscal behaviour may also play a role.',\n",
       " 'Rising long-term government bond yields may only have a gradual impact on government borrowing costs, as changes in interest rates only affect the cost of newly issued debt and debt at variable interest rates.',\n",
       " 'However, they may signal both a reduced willingness on the part of investors to provide long-term funding as well as difficulty in accessing capital market funds.',\n",
       " 'So far, most euro area countries have enjoyed relatively low interest rates on new government debt issuance, despite facing considerably more difficult market conditions.',\n",
       " 'Looking ahead, as the economy recovers and competition for financing increases, governments may face higher bond yields again.',\n",
       " 'Discretionary use of fiscal policy     In addition to providing financial support to the banking sector, euro area governments reacted forcefully to counter the negative impact of the financial turmoil on the real economy.',\n",
       " 'Besides the operation of automatic stabilisers, which provide a significant cushion to the euro area economy by way of lower tax revenues and higher spending on unemployment benefits, the discretionary use of fiscal policy helped to mitigate the effects of the global economic downturn.',\n",
       " 'However, fiscal stimulus measures need to remain temporary and be combined with measures that ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium run.',\n",
       " 'This will preserve trust in the sustainability of public finances and support both the recovery and long-term economic growth.',\n",
       " 'For 2009 and 2010, the European Commission estimates the overall fiscal impulse to the euro area economy, as measured by the change in the general government deficit, to be about 4.6% of GDP, 60% of which is due to the automatic stabilisers.',\n",
       " 'While the recent coordinated fiscal loosening has been broadly accepted as a legitimate and necessary step in the short run, given the exceptional economic circumstances, it also entails a significant fiscal burden.',\n",
       " 'The latest available economic forecasts (EC Spring 2009 Economic Forecasts) point to dramatic developments in euro area public finances.',\n",
       " 'In addition to a rapidly deteriorating general government deficit, which is expected to be above 6% of euro area GDP in 2010, the euro area debt ratio will increase by about 15 percentage points to above 80% of GDP by 2010.',\n",
       " 'In both 2009 and 2010 13 out of 16 euro area countries are expected to have a budget deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value.',\n",
       " 'These figures are very high, though they compare favourably with other major economic regions that have also provided a substantial fiscal impulse to their economy.',\n",
       " 'The budget deficit in both the United Kingdom and the United States is projected to be about 14% of GDP in 2010, whereas in Japan it is projected to be about 9% of GDP.',\n",
       " 'Against this backdrop, euro area countries must reject calls for additional fiscal loosening.',\n",
       " 'In the current environment, any further fiscal stimulus is likely to be counterproductive as it could hamper the economic recovery in two ways.',\n",
       " 'First of all, even higher fiscal deficits could fuel market concerns about a country’s ability to meet its future debt obligations, thus putting upward pressure on interest rates.',\n",
       " 'Second, increasing budget deficits would also raise concerns about a higher tax burden in the future, thus inducing consumers to save rather than spend any additional income.',\n",
       " 'Let me now turn to two important questions regarding the fiscal authorities’ response to the economic crisis.',\n",
       " 'First, do the measures have the potential to restore confidence?',\n",
       " 'Second, are those measures effective?',\n",
       " 'The financial sector support measures, combined with the Eurosystem’s enhanced credit support measures, were successful in safeguarding the stability of the financial system.',\n",
       " 'Together, these initiatives have the potential to tackle the crisis of confidence at its root also by taking into account the fundamental role of the banking sector in the functioning of the economy.',\n",

       " 'The high-level expert group headed by Jacques de Larosière, former Governor of the Bank of France and Managing Director of the IMF, has identified a number of weaknesses in the supervisory framework both inside and outside Europe that contributed to the build-up of the current crisis.',\n",
       " 'One of the group’s proposals is to give the ECB more responsibility for so-called macro-prudential supervision.',\n",
       " 'This means supervision that aims to limit the risk of distress in the financial system as a whole, but does not extend to supervision of individual financial institutions.',\n",
